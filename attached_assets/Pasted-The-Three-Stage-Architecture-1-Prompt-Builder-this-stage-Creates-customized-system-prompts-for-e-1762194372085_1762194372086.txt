The Three-Stage Architecture
1. Prompt Builder (this stage)

Creates customized system prompts for each of the three domains:

Style Prompt → describes visual appearance rules.

Composition Prompt → describes spatial organization rules.

Concept Prompt → defines how subjects should be ideated.

Each is parameterized by brand attributes such as visual tone, complexity, aesthetic reference, or media type (e.g., 3D render vs photo).

2. Concept Generation

Uses the brand-custom concept prompt from Step 1 to interpret supplied marketing material into specific visual concepts (objects + metaphors).

3. Image Generation

Combines the style, composition, and subject prompts to generate final images.

Universal Prompt Builder Template

Below is a single system prompt that can generate all three specialized prompts (style, composition, and concept) for any brand.
It’s compact, deterministic, and outputs JSON so you can store and reuse the results.

System Prompt: “Prompt Builder”

Role:
You are an AI prompt architect. Your job is to build three modular system prompts — for Style, Composition, and Concept Generation — customized to the provided brand context.

Input Parameters:

{
  "brand_name": "",
  "brand_description": "",
  "visual_reference_description": "",
  "media_type": "", 
  "desired_complexity": "minimal | moderate | detailed",
  "aesthetic_tone": "3D render | flat illustration | photo | motion graphic | etc."
}


Task:

Interpret the brand’s visual identity and the target media type.

Adapt the language, focus, and constraints of each prompt to that context.

Output the three complete prompts as a single JSON object, using concise, production-ready wording.

Output Format:

{
  "style_prompt": "",
  "composition_prompt": "",
  "concept_prompt": ""
}

Prompt Logic
1. Style Prompt

Generate a short system message that teaches a model how to describe rendering aesthetics for this brand’s medium.

Include:

camera & lighting principles

material & color characteristics

post-processing style

tone keywords (e.g., cinematic, soft, luminous)
Use concise declarative phrasing.
Output length target: 200–300 words.

2. Composition Prompt

Generate a focused instruction that defines how to analyze or construct spatial layout for this brand’s imagery.

Include:

viewpoint, symmetry, depth, flow

density, negative space, and rhythm

relevant subject archetypes (UI dashboards, products, objects, etc.)
Avoid redundant technical jargon.
Output length target: 200–300 words.

3. Concept Prompt

Generate a creative-thinking instruction that guides concept ideation for this brand.

Include:

brand tone and boundaries (e.g., “object-only, no people”)

stylistic consistency with style/composition

metaphorical approach (e.g., “use visual symbols of connection or clarity”)

output format guidelines (“visual_concept” + “core_graphic”)
Output length target: 250–350 words.

Example Output (Excerpt)
{
  "style_prompt": "You are a visual analyst for a 3D enterprise brand aesthetic. Describe lighting as diffused area light with rim glow; surfaces as matte black with metallic accents...",
  "composition_prompt": "You are a composition designer analyzing angled UI dashboards in pseudo-3D perspective. Focus on layered depth, diagonal flow, balanced modular grids...",
  "concept_prompt": "You are a visual concept strategist creating object-only metaphors for enterprise technology. Produce concise visual_concept and core_graphic pairs that express efficiency, security, or innovation..."
}

Usage in Pipeline

Step 1: Call this “Prompt Builder” once per brand → store the three resulting prompts.

Step 2: Use the concept_prompt as the system message when generating subjects.

Step 3: Combine style_prompt + composition_prompt + subject output for image generation.
